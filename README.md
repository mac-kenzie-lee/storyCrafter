# Story Crafter
Story Crafter helps identify correlations in your professional careers that might have been overlooked. Currently, it allows users to write down their 'wins' or successes in their professional career, as well as list software/technology or tools that may have been used in the past. Story Crafter aims to help you remember what you've learned and accomplished throughout your experiences.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Story Crafter utilizes flexbox, Javascript DOM manipulation techniques, and local storage to manage, and allow for persistent data for users without the need for heavy databases and user accounts. 

## Optimizations

Story Crafter's initial data storage was optimized through the use of local storage. 

## Lessons Learned:

The organization of the code was a little bit unwieldy at times, while I set up the js data functionality, it wasn't exactly as clean and lightweight as desired. Perhaps going in and improving the code with classes or a component structure would be more beneficial for adding additional features. 

## Planned Additions: 

Adding more career planning, and writing functionality is desired for the future, as well as UI/UX improvements, and rebranding the website design.
